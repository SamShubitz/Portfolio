      <p>
        I like making React apps and am interested in all things to do with
        software development. My professional background is in teaching music
        and foreign language, and I see coding as another expression of the same
        things that make those subjects fun to learn and think about. I'm hoping
        for a position where I can continue to sharpen my skills as a developer
        while also having the privilege of working with and learning from
        others.
      </p>
